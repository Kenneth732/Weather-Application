## Getting started

Welcome to the Search Weather Condition project, which will help in checking weather of places, this is a demonstration of what I have learnt so far, using iteration of Arrays(looping), DOM manipulation, Communication with a server using the fetch API and json-server package.

## Project setup

To run this application:

- making the repository from scratch[Weather Application](https://github.com). If you see a 404, in the page when trying to clone, kindly ask me to add you to the repository as a contributor.
- Run `npm install` to install all necessary packages for the applction to work.
- Ensure that you have the json data as below:

# Technology used
HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, 
- After everything is installed, run the command `json-server -w db.json` while in the project directory / folder.
- Open the `index.html` file in the browser, and start interacting with the application

## How to use the application

1. When you open the `index.html` file in the browser, you should see a search input for serching places. None is slected at first.

2. This A]lication will help find weather on place yo are and places you my like to visite

3. to find or seach new nation you will need to type new nation on the input and search us for the last search will not longer being showing.
